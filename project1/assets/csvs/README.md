##Difference between Quaker_Necrology_Full_Data and Quaker_Necrology_Filtered_Data

Quaker_Necrology_Full_Data contains all the information about the Quakers obtained 
from the reference cards while Quaker_Necrology_Filtered_Data contains select information
from the Full Data that I thought would be useful to include in the datatables as of now.
