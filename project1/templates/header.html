	<p> Welcome to the Quaker Necrology Database. This database includes the index of death notices and obituaries from Quaker periodicals from 1828 to the present. The database serves as an index and not a complete abstract of the information found in each obituary. It includes the information that we thought was necessary for the purposes of identification. That information includes the fullnames, dates of birth and death, and the Quaker periodicals. Below are the titles of these periodicals:</p>
         <ul>
         	<li>The American Friend 1894-1960 (Five Years Meeting â€“ Orthodox)</li>
         	<li>Evangelical Friend 1905-1914, 1929-1994 (Ohio)</li>
         	<li>Friend Bulletin 1934-2008 (Pacific Yearly Meeting)</li>
         	<li>Friends Weekly Intelligencer 1844-1853 (Philadelphia, Pa.- Hicksite)</li>
         	<li>Friends Intelligencer 1853-1885 (Philadelphia, Pa.)</li>
         	<li>Friends Intelligencer and Journal 1888-1901 (Philadelphia, Pa.)</li>
         	<li>Friends Intelligencer 1902-1955 (Philadelphia, Pa.)</li>
